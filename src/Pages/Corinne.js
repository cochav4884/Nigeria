                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  Born to Manuel Padilla and Cynthia Peters on March 24, 1979, in AppleValley, California, I grew
                  up poor and fully aware. By the age of four, I could decern between the good and bad in people. I knew their true
                  intentions. I looked to my parents and other adults in my life to understand why good would be done over bad
                  and why bad would be done over good. I remember taking all the good adults did towards others, and started
                  building my core beliefs. My core beliefs would eventually be how I would treat others and how I would allow
                  them to treat me. My core values to this day are: 1) Don't Steal; 2) Don't Cheat; 3) Don't Lie; 4) Don't Hit; 5)
                  Don't Call Me Dump. I learned that sometimes you accept what is and make the best of it. I trust with ease and
                  look for the good in people, no matter how small it may be. God was in and out of my life depending on who was
                  in my life at the time. As a child, adults are responsible for all things that nourish our bodies including
                  spiritually. As I became older, I had a lot of resentment towards God for not saving me from bad people. As an
                  adult I learned how much He was there for me; I just didn't know it.

                <h2>Family and Support</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  I met Richie Osborne September 14, 2021. We have been through a lot together and independently.
                  Richie Osborne is my biggest supporter when it comes to building a new life and career. I am recently divorced
                  from my second marriage. I helped raise many children and had three of my own. I went from a stay-at-home mom
                  with multiple skills, jobs, and education on my belt, to a single parent of adult children trying to figure it
                  all out again. Richie and I support each other in health, sickness, hobbies, work experience, education, and
                  spiritually. We enjoy reading the bible and discussing how we understand what we read. Sometimes we are both
                  in sync, others we are helping the other to understand, and then there are times when we have to research what
                  we read to get a better understanding.

                <h2>Education and Career</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  The first to graduate from college, I earned my Cosmetology License on September 17, 1998. Gave
                  birth to my first child November 26, 1998. Worked many odd jobs since the age of eight through today. I gave
                  birth to my second child July 20, 2001. Attempted college a second time and had to resign. Started a daycare
                  after giving birth to my third child on April 17, 2003. Along with daycare I worked on hair and nails to help
                  pay for bills. I later attempted college again and had to resign again. I focused on raising my kids and
                  helping others with theirs until my kids started entering school. I then became an avid volunteer earning me a
                  honorary award for most hours volunteered that school year. It was a book made by the preschool students that had the
                  words they learned to spell that year. Once my kids were all above four years old, I earned my school bus
                  driver's license. I drove school buses in both the state of California, United States, and the state of Idaho,
                  United States.

                <h2>Later Education & Volunteering</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  After returning home from Idaho, United States, I chose to go back to school for the third time.
                  This time I was successful. I received certificates for two majors. The first in Social Science with a
                  concentration in Political Science and Government. The second was in Sociology. I took real interest in
                  Anthropology course. My interest was piqued once we started learning about local tribes and how the western
                  ways began affecting their way of life. I have always been into people, how they function as a group and
                  individually. My biggest interest are the roles people take within group settings and how each role is an
                  important part of keeping the entirety of the group working cohesively. By this time my kids were old enough
                  to volunteer alongside me within our community. As time went on most of what we had been doing was placed on
                  their school records as community volunteer hours.

                <p className="born">
                  I attempted college again years later in 2020 and 2021, but unfortunately was forced to take a
                  leave of absence both times due to covid related struggles and homelessness. I recently came off of being
                  homeless January 21, 2022. My poor vehicle has more interior wear than it should, but we made it through our
                  third time being homeless since this pandemic started. My good friend Richie was a big part of this last
                  year. He helped me through some very tough times.

                <h2>Bitwise Coding Journey</h2>
                <p className="born">
                  February 19, 2022, I was contacted by an employee who works for Bitwise Industries and told about
                  their Bitwise Workforce Training classes in coding for web design. At first it seemed too good to be true, but
                  after a one-on-one with this person, I took the opportunity to start classes. My very first look at coding was
                  February 23, 2022. Like LEGOS and Minecraft before this, I took to learning and creating within days of seeing
                  coding. I learned so quickly that I was fortunate to help others who were struggling with coding. I have
                  prepared for this moment my whole life. Every time I played a strategic board game, read mysteries, worked
                  puzzles, moved into LEGO play and then introduced to Minecraft...I was being groomed for the best skill I have
                  ever learned...coding for web design. My first course was in Website for Beginners, I am currently in Mobile
                  Friendly and this is my final project to present at the end of this course. I will continue with
                  JavaScript for Beginners and move on to the final course React. By the end of this course, I hope to have this
                  website fully functioning and on the internet!
